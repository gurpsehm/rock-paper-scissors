# rock-paper-scissors
Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project

Creating a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer using the random function and JavaScript to determine the character's moves and code the game

# Plan
* No graphical user interface, the game will be played using the browser's console
* Input choices will be the user choosing rock, paper or scissors and the computer randomly choosing an option after the user's choice

# Pseudocode

If the user's input is a move that beats the computer's move
  Display the player winning
Otherwise if the computer's move is one that beats the player's move
  Display the computer winning
Otherwise display a message showing that the match was a tie
