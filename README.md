# rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors project for The Odin Project

Creating a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer using the random function and JavaScript to determine the character's moves and code the game

# Plan

* No graphical user interface, the game will be played using the browser's console
* Input choices will be the user choosing rock, paper or scissors and the computer randomly choosing an option after the user's choice

# Pseudocode

Initialize variable for the player's move

Initialize variable for the computer's move



Ask for the user's input

Use random function to determine computer's move

If the user's input is a move that beats the computer's move

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display the player winning

Otherwise if the computer's move is one that beats the player's move

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display the computer winning

Otherwise display a message showing that the match was a tie

# What I Learned

* Practicing how to create a plan for the project that I'm working on
* Learning how to create Pseudocode before starting a project 
* Learned the basics of making a JavaScript project and how to link it to an HTML file
* Learning the basics of how to use for loops to help create a score system for the game being created
* Practice Google searching problems that I can't figure out on my own
